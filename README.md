## Use Async or Defer

![Async or Defer](async.png)

- Use `async` if it's important to have the script run earlier in the loading process. This might include some analytics scripts, for example. Also use it if you do not care about execution order or it doesn't rely on any other script.
- Use `defer` for less critical resources. A video player that's below-the-fold, for example.
- Use `defer` in the beginning of the html
